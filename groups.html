<p>Description:“I am stockpiling antibiotics for the Apocalypse, even as I await the blossoming of paperwhites on the windowsill in the kitchen,” Anne Lamott admits at the beginning of Almost Everything. Despair and uncertainty surround us: in the news, in our families, and in ourselves. But even when life is at its bleakest–when we are, as she puts it, “doomed, stunned, exhausted, and over-caffeinated”–the seeds of rejuvenation are at hand. “All truth is paradox,” Lamott writes, “and this turns out to be a reason for hope. If you arrive at a place in life that is miserable, it will change.” That is the time when we must pledge not to give up but “to do what Wendell Berry wrote: ‘Be joyful, though you have considered all the facts.'”

    In this profound and funny book, Lamott calls for each of us to rediscover the nuggets of hope and wisdom that are buried within us that can make life sweeter than we ever imagined. Divided into short chapters that explore life’s essential truths, Almost Everything pinpoints these moments of insight as it shines an encouraging light forward.</p>

<p>Description:That challenge hit home. I was always one to choose the easier path, but soon, I found myself backpacking alone through Nepal, heading for the renowned Mt. Everest Base Camp in search of purpose and meaning.

    On that winding trail, I stumbled upon a different reality. Young boys and girls, out of school and struggling in jobs that hardly paid. 
    
    Then, there was Madan, a 16-year-old porter. He shared that not too long ago, he walked 3 to 4 hours every day to get to school, filled with dreams. Now, he had to work just to get by.
    
    At the start, the path was unclear, but a calling had found me. I felt a strong need to make a difference, to merge my passion for entrepreneurship and love for education to lift those at the very bottom.
    
    Today, with unwavering support from hundreds like yourself, we've made strides, funding dozens of classroom projects, and in 2023 placing a special focus on girls' education in Nepal.
    
    But we're just getting started.
    
    The world is brimming with potential, and we invite you to join us. Together, we can break down barriers to learning, one book at a time.</p>
