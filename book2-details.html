            <h2>You Can</h2>
            <p>Author: George Matthew Adams</p>
            <p>Description:</p>
            <p1>There's a man in the world who is never turned down,
                wherever he chances to stray; he gets the glad hand in the populous town, or out where the farmers make hay; he's
                greeted with pleasure on deserts of sand, and deep in the
                aisles of the woods; wherever he goes there's the welcoming
                hand—he's The Man Who Delivers The Goods. The
                failures of life sit around and complain; the gods haven't
                treated them white; they've lost their umbrellas whenever
                there's rain, and they haven't their lanterns at night; men
                tire of the failures who fill with their sighs the air of their own neighborhoods; there's one who is greeted with lovelighted eyes—he's The Man Who Delivers The Goods.
                One fellow is lazy, and watches the clock, and waits for the
                whistle to blow; and one has a hammer, with which he will knock, and one tells a story of woe; and one, if requested to
                travel a mile, vnll measure the perches and roods; but one
                does his stunt with a whistle or smile—he's The Man Who
                Delivers The Goods. One man is afraid that he'll labor
                too hard—the world isn't yearning for such; and one man
                is always alert, on his guard, lest he put in a minute too much; and one has a grouch or a temper that's bad, and one
                is a creature of moods; so it's hey for the joyous and rollick- ing lad—for the One Who Delivers The Goods. —Walt Maso</p1>
            <p2>THE little Talks that make up these pages were
                written quite as much to help me as to help you
                who honor me by reading them. As a matter of common fact we are all inherently related to each other,
                so that what I have for you, you have for me.
                Other minds—away back, and all along into the now
                —
                have given to me, and I, as a sort of Un-ordained
                Fashioner, hand over to you what was in the first place
                as much meant for you as for me. If you catch fire from
                contact with the ideas and suggestions that these few
                pages clothe anew, this book shall havebeen Worth While.
                The easiest thing in the world is to Succeed. You can't
                help it if you follow the rules and play the game the
                best way you know how according to Yourself, instead of
                according to the one next to you, or above you, or
                somewhere away from you.
                One thing I hope—and that is that you will feel the
                htaman warmth of sincere Purpose that first inspired
                these little Talks. To me the pleasure of Work and
                Achievement is so great that for you to get my experience, shall mean increased pleasure returned to me.
                As I Was Saying
                Most of these suggestions were written between tasks
                while the plowing and work of tilling the business soil was
                at full energy. Some were written at Night, at Morning, on Trains, in Hotels, and some while "out on pleasure
                bent." They have all been squeezed out of busy hours,
                which in turn is an apology for everything they lack
                except the desire back of them to be Helpful.
                So, I walk as another human in the ranks and join you
                in your largest Success. YOU CAN—I know.
                G. M. A.</p2>
            <p3>Silence
                YES, Silence is many times Golden. You know
                that. But try to realize it more strongly. For
                the Silent Man is usually the Thinking Man and
                the Silent Worker is the Get-Things-Done Worker.
                But best of all, Silence as a rule of daily life Conduct
                makes you Big and Powerful.
                Don't talk Back.
                The World's great Doers have all been Men and
                Women of few words—Napoleon, Cromwell, Washington,
                Grant, Lincoln, Marshall Field—Edison. These men
                didn't have time for disputes, wrangles—revenges. Don't talk Back.
                The World is coming to the Idea of Silence—^fewer Words, more Deed-doing. It is the big Law of Nature.
                It is becoming the great Law of Business. For Silence
                can't be answered. There is nothing to answer. Don't talk Back.
                Look aroujid you. You admire the SUent people
                —
                those who mind their own business and Birild. You
                know the names of the Useful men of your town. You
                can't waste their time—you can't get them "mad."
                You can't steal anything from them. Their Silence
                is their Wealth and every time they walk along the
                streets they speak volumes. Add another motto to those you may already have. Make it this—Silence. Don't talk Back.

                Health
                FEW people Wear out before their time. Mostly
                they Rust out. Worry out, Run out—SpiU out. A
                Machine must have care and its different parts
                must be adjusted properly. No Machine has ever approached the Human Machine. When it is right, it
                is in Health.
                Make Confidants of Air and Exercise.
                No great Battle was ever won with antiquated Artillery. Nor is it possible for Men or Women to give
                the best that is in them, aided by weak, ill cared for,
                abused Bodies. For Health puts on the alert every
                quality of Soul and makes the Brain and Heart and
                Nerve stations work in even unison, throbbing out big
                things in Deeds.
                Make Confidants of Air and Exercise.
                Pure Air, wholesome Exercise, a few good "Hobbies"
                put an edge to a human being that all the Pills in creation
                can't equal. In addition, by touching up your Face with
                plenty of 22-Karat Smiles, you have briefly a Home
                Remedy for Health of great power and very practicable.
                Make Confidants of Air and Exercise.
                You have time to eat, you have time to make money,
                you have time to take to your bed when abuse brings on aches—you will have to take time to die. It is good sense, then, to take time to get Health.
                Make Confidants of Air and Exercise.
                Everybody is quickened and inspired by the vibrating
                Health and warm Magnetism that is felt instantly from
                the Healthy man. He is the man who does things.
                He is the man who is a Success. He is the fellow who
                has time to take on Air and Exercise and grasp Health.</p3>
            <p4>HARACTER is the sum total, worth while, of what a man has after he has won all and the sole thing he has left after he has lost all. Character is Power.
                J. Pierpont Morgan, the greatest single power in Finance in all the world, at the time of his death, once
                stated under oath, that "Character is the only gauge of a man, or the only rule by which he can be gauged in business, and that physical assets are therefore of secondary importance."
                Character is Power.
                The walls of Character that a man builds will withstand the most merciless assaults that any man can
                direct at them. A man's or a woman's good Character
                is absolutely unassailable. Reputation may be besmirched—but not Character. For Reputation is what
                people may say a man is, but Character is what he
                really is. Character is Power.
                [5]
                You Can
                Character is greater than talent, genius, fame, money,
                friends—there is nothing to compare with it. A man
                may have all these and yet remain comparatively useless—be unhappy—and die a bankrupt in Soul. But —Character pays out endless Dividends, molds a man into a mighty Deed-doer, and builds for him a deathless
                Name.
                Character is Power.
                Character is Power in Business, in the Home, on the
                Street—ever3rwhere. And it's free for the asking to the
                man willing to be kind, honest, square, broad, generous,
                loyal, fearless—Big! Stamp your Character deeper on
                people to-day and make it rule your work. Let it lead
                you on. But fight every hour to make it stronger,
                for—
                Character is Power.
                Mistakes
                STUDY your Mistakes.
                There are two kinds of Mistakes. Those that
                happen from ordinary human mis-thinking and
                those that come from carelessness and petty un-thinking.
                Study your Mistakes.
                No one ever gets too big to make Mistakes. The
                secret is that the big man is greater than his Mistakes,
                because he rises right out of them and passes beyond
                them.
                After one of Henry Ward Beecher's sermons in Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, a young man came up to him
                and said: "Mr. Beecher, did you know that you made
                a grammatical error in your sermon this morning?"
                "A grammatical error," answered Beecher, "I'll bet
                my hat that I made forty of them."
                [6]
                You Can
                Half of the power of the forceftil man springs out of
                his Mistakes of one sort or another. They hdp to keep
                him human.
                Study your Mistakes.
                But the Mistakes that tear away the power of a man,
                weaken him, and make him flabby, are the stupid, the
                reckless Mistakes. The Clerk who forgets, the Stenographer that doesn't care, the Worker who neglects
                —
                these are the ones whose life blood and vitality is sapped and sucked away into failure. Study your Mistakes.
                One of the great things of each day for you is to do
                your best—immindful of Mistakes. But after your
                work is done and you realize your blunders, don't shirk,
                don't whine, don't despond, but
                —
                Study your Mistakes.
                Then profit from them—and go ahead</p4>
            <p5>NEof the important lessons of this life is to learn
                to keep out of Ruts. Everyone is bound to
                strike them at times. But they should be gotten
                out of—immediately. For to stay in a Rut is to stick
                still—and stagnate, while others pass you and forget
                you.
                Keep your eyes Open and your Mind Awake.
                Watch out for the Imitation Rut—the Rut that takes
                you away from your own Work and your own Ideas and
                makes a Duplicate out of you instead of an Original.
                Creators stand in a class by themselves. Pay tribute to the Head on yoxir own shoulders. Get the habit of
                Initiation. Keep your Eyes Open and your Mind Awake.
                [7]
                You Can
                Think. Get together new Ideas. Welcome them.
                Read. Profit from the Minds of past ages. Compare
                them with the advancing Thought and Experiences of
                your own age. Delve into the Mysteries. Seek out
                the Truths they hold. Learn SOMETHING new each
                day—and you will be ready armed against getting into
                Ruts.
                Keep your Eyes Open and your Mind Awake.
                Vary your Work each day as greatly as possible.
                Think out new ways of doing old Tasks. The Brain
                acts spryest when it is most interested. Love your
                Work. If you don't, find Work that you do. Keep your Eyes Open and your Mind Awake.
                And be kind to your own human Machine. Give it Rest. Occasionally slip away into new Surrotmdings,
                see new Faces, and meet new Scenes. Find delight
                among those who Do and Dare. Lock arms with the
                Smilers—pass by the Frowners. Now, read this little talk over again—resolving that you will from this time on stay out of the Rut business.
                Together
                FOR the sake of this little Talk, let us suppose that
                the one word Together is derived from the three
                words—TO GET THERE. It is quite possible,
                anyway. For when people get themselves Together,
                or you collect all your individual forces Together, the
                thing aimed at usually happens.
                TO GET THERE is to get Together.
                Analyze a Human Failure. Here is what you learn. He is all apart—all unhitched. His Brain is without
                organization. Most of his fine sensibilities are stunned
                (8J
                You Can
                or dead. His Will isn't Landlord any more. It's just a Boarder—and half starved at that. His original force of Executives and assistants—once alert and
                healthy and willing—have all gone out into the yard
                to Doze. Confusion and Ruin is everywhere. Chaos
                reigns. What is the Remedy? This
                —
                TO GET THERE is to get Together.
                It's marvelous the change that comes about when a man gets Together all his Forces and centers them upon
                the doing of ONE thing at a time. The Together idea
                is the progressive idea. "Where there is a Will, there
                is a Way." But the Will is of no use without the Plan
                back of the Will. Plan, Will—Way. All Together
                and things are accomplished.
                TO GET THERE is to get Together.
                When you begin to Divide your interests or to Distribute your forces, you begin to lose yotur Grip. As
                you draw aU your Forces Together, you increase your
                Power. Big things are done on the Together plan.
                Bird shot will IdU small game but it takes the single Rifle balls to bring down the big game.
                TO GET THERE is to get Together.
                Weigh and consider this thought as you face your
                work each day. Give it an honor place as a working
                nile. Get Together. Then stick Together.
                Win
                THE very first commandment in the decalogue of
                Winning is to
                —
                Keep your Chin up
                !
                Get busy at the first job that you run into or that runs into you. Tackle it "on all fours," if necessary. Center your whole enthusiasm in it. Study its every
                [9]
                You Can
                detail. Drive yotir very Heart interest into it. But
                don't forget to
                —
                Keep your Chin up.
                People who look down never get much of an idea of
                the sky where the Stars are set. And the fellow who
                doesn't hitch at least one or two of his wagons to a Star never gets very high up. Get your eyes off the ground.
                Look ahead.
                Keep your Chin up.
                For, after all, Winning is a thing within—then out. No other man will or can Win for you. No other man
                in all the world, no matter how exalted, has the ability
                and power that is concentrated in you, waiting for some match of Action to touch it off. Also, your Success can be as the Success of no other man. But you
                alone must find the Thing and DO the Work. It's great fun, too, if you
                —
                Keep your Chin up.
                It is easier to Win than to Fail. Everybody sides
                with the Winner. But the Failure walks alone. Keep your Chin up.
                Remembering that to Win is to do your work well
                —
                to-day. The thiag delayed or put off is the thing undone. Start right now. Straighten your shoialders. Set your eyes ahead. Clench your fist—close your
                jaw, and
                —
                Keep your Chin up.
                And you will WIN!

                Earth move in its path, so does Time move on. It never stops to tie its shoestrings. It never waits.
                Time is EflEort, harnessed and worked to a fuU day's
                portion.
                Time has no Business, boasts no monied Millions,
                hires no fast-legged Errand Boys, houses no Clerks,
                thinks no Problems, rules no States. Time IS Business,
                Money, the Errand Boy, the Clerk, the Problem, the
                State!
                Time is but the man in the job put to action and to work.
                And Time used to profit To-day will acctunulate
                Power for you To-morrow just as sure as Time goes on. Meditate not on Trifles. Attempt big things. Remembering that
                —
                This day will never dawn again
                !
                And yet, mighty as Time is, priceless in comparison
                to all else in the world, Time is the freest thing in existence. Perhaps that is why so many fail to grasp it with earnestness and with enthusiasm? Perhaps that
                is why so few realize its presence and let it pass on ? Think! No matter what yovu- work to-day, if it is worth while at all—Time to plan it out, Time to do it
                well, and Time to finish it, is your day's greatest gift
                and your greatest job. , Learn to use your Time.

                Backbone
                THERE are two kinds of Backbones—the one with
                the Back and no Bone and the one with both
                Back and Bone! Backbone! what great things
                have been put across in your name
                !
                Stiffen your Backbone.
                It is a great thing to have a big Brain, a fertile Imagination, grand Ideals, but the man with these, bereft of a good Backbone is sure to serve no useful end.
                Stiffen your Backbone.
                There is a little vine that starts at the base of great
                trees. Then it climbs and twines about until it squeezes
                and saps away unto death the tree around which it
                clings. It has not a Backbone—^no vital individual
                strength of its own, so it seeks out to tear down and
                kill where there is strength, power and life. That is what Backbone-less people do.
                Stiffen your Backbone.
                Use it to stand alone with. Use it to bolster up
                your own individual resources. Use it to strengthen
                weaker Backbones than your own. Use it for the working out of your entire Character. Then Deeds Done, will gather about you in Battalions, and Opportunity will stand around anxious to introduce you to her friends. Stiffen your Backbone.
                Use your Backbone at your job to-day—you who
                clerk, you whose fingers pound the type keys, you whose
                brains formulate plans, distribute details and master
                problems. For the temple of Success is upheld by the
                strong arms of men and women who have Backbone and
                use it.

                EMERSON says that "the strongest man on earth
                is the man who stands most alone." Owe money —be in Debt—and you stand by the props that
                the sweat of other men's brows and the gray of other
                men's brains have earned and bought. You don't

                Abhor Debt. Pay.
                Debt means to owe—somebody else. It means that
                you give up what might be yours. It means that you
                offer a part of yourself for sale for a definite simi. When
                you owe money you make yourself a slave. The other

                The quickest way to kill a Friend (the most valuable

                Be Somebody in the Crowd—Cotmt.
                No man ever Counts until he assumes Responsibility.
                Responsibility demands the work of the Brain and Heart. These two, working together, breed Ideas. Then Results

                Be Somebody in the Crowd—Count.

                to Cotmt—if you want to be singled out and justly

                Be Somebody in the Crowd—Cotmt.
                Nothing stirs and inspires more than to have it said that
                you are Somebody and that—you Cotmt—that you are a

                Before you do a thing—ask Why ? Let Why lead you on and save you Power. Simply
                answer with promptness its Silent questionings. Give
                tmto Why a substantial reason for the fiber that is within you.
                Before you do a thing—ask Why ? Ask yourself: "Why should I do this thing? Why
                should I refuse to do it ?" Put your actions to the Why
                test. Think of the wealth of happiness that the habitual use of Why can bring you!

            <p7>Frankness
                FRANKNESS is the art of saying things you honestly
                think exactly as you think them. To be Frank
                is to be naturally straightforward.
                Look the other fellow in the Eye.
                Just as a straight line is the shortest distance between
                two points, so is Frankness the only right course between
                all people. Because nothing is wasted. The Frank
                man is the only man worthy of trust. Look the other feUow in the Eye.
                Frankness between Employer and Employee, Frankness between a Man or a Woman, Frankness between
                yoiu^elf and the one who disagrees with you, is the only
                sensible way.
                Look the other fellow in the Eye.
                The beginning of mutual respect is trust. No satis- factory restdt in anything was ever achieved without
                Frankness.
                Look the other fellow in the Eye.
                Never think that Frankness is Impudence, nor crude
                Opinion. It is the face to face openness of Mind and
                Heart that challenges immediate acceptance of what
                you have to say as the uncoated Truth.
                Look the other fellow in the Eye.
                To-day, don't hedge. Stand squarely on your own
                legs. Be Frank. And you will marvel at the ease with which other people will understand and respect
                you. Frankness, a very precious possession, is possible to aJl—save one, the Coward. You—start to put
                Frankness into use. Make it earn its board and lodging.
                Say out what you have to say—with Frankness.

                THE most marvelous of all pieces of work is the
                human Face. Strange that out of all the billions of Faces made since Time got to going, no two
                Faces have ever been exactly alike. Strange, too, that no one Face long remains the same
                !
                Make Something of YOUR Face. The Face is the Revelation of Character. As surely
                and positively as does the hand guided by the orders
                of the Brain clear wide wastes, build great cities, and
                cut into life-like figures from bare rocks the story of
                men's achievements, so does the Brain and Thought
                of a man carve and fashion daily the secret workings of his Ideals and Purposes into the Lines and Planes of his own Pace. Make Something of YOUR Face. There is one thing a man cannot hide from—his own
                Face! Where the Man goes the Face must go. How
                tremendous the responsibility, then, of making your
                Face a good Companion, a faithful Servant, an active
                Force, an interesting Study—a Face worth remembering
                !
                Make Something of YOUR Face. The only way to make Something of your Face is to make Something of your Character.
                A Face never lies. It may be a Comic Picture, a Comedy of Errors, a Shakespearean Tragedy, a chiseled
                piece of Power, or a wrecked god—but it is no lie. If you would know yotur Friend, study the history of his Face.

                of person a man is, study his Face. His Character is proclaimed there as Trumpet Tones. Pope said that the
                proper study of mankind was man. But the way to study a man is to study his Face. Be not so foolish as to try to "hop bail" on your own Face. You can't. Better start associating more with it. It is your largest
                asset, for no man can take it from you. Realize now,
                then, that the most important job for you each day is to—
                Make SOMETHING of your Face.

                —
                remember the name—once wrote thtese wonderful

                live as if you were to die to-morrow."
                Be Responsible, first, to Yourself.
                Responsibility is one thing that all must face and
                that none can escape. It starts with the baby in the
                cradle. It never ends! For the Responsibility of a man goes on even after his work in the flesh is over. A man performs a great deed. It lives in printed pages
                and goes on in its influence as long as there is any life in the world at all. Be Responsible, first, to Yourself. Individual Responsibility ! It's the thing that makes
                the Man. Without it there is no Man. Bear in mind,
                you who must realize Responsibility to your Employer,
                or to your Friend, or to your Home,—your first Responsibility is to Yourself. And if you are weak and false to yourself—if you wabble in doing the things that

                You Can
                mean your very life and Success—you are already a
                Failtire. Be Responsible, first, to Yourself. Then FEEL your Responsibility. No one is useless who believes that some things depend upon him alone. You who read this little preachment, take it to heart. Be unafraid of at least attempting larger things. Convince your own self that you have worth and can prove
                it—and the tasks of big moment will take care of you
                and lift you into importance and affluence—the gifts of having the courage to take Responsibility and shoulder
                it. But, remember to

                The biggest man or woman who ever lived, was in no

                —
                the stronger your own individual influence and Character becomes. Suppose you try it out to-day and learn

                People do the things they first see done with their Imagination. McAdoo with the eye of his mind saw
                rapid cars taking thousands of people daily under the
                Hudson river. Of course, people turned their heads and
                smiled at his dream. But McAdoo made real his dream
                in the Hudson tunnels. Marconi saw the messages of
                people thousands of miles away floating on the waves
                of the air and sounded ofiE at a marvelous instrument.
                He was at once rated as crazy. But he went ahead and

                presented to an astonished world the unbelievable
                Wireless telegraph
                !
                Cultivate your Imagination.
                People call America the "land of Opportunity." It
                is the land of Imagination. Here the humblest rises to the greatest position of power. It's the working of Imagination that contributes most. The obscure clerk
                sees himself President of the concern he serves. Then
                he advances step by step until he realizes his aim. His
                first step toward the President's job was to see himself
                with his Imagination, occupying it. Cultivate you Imagination.
                The great Perthes once said " that a quick Imagination
                is the salt of earthly life, without which nature is but a
                skeleton; but the higher the gift the greater the responsibility."
                Cultivate your Imagination.
                Cultivate it in little things. Then the little things will become big things. Then the big things will take their
                place among the undying things. History is but the
                story of the achievements of people who had Imagination.
                Cultivate your Imagination.
                Ghosts
                THERE is nothing in Ghosts. But they do exist. Ghosts are nothing more nor less than the phantom Imaginations of sick, afraid Minds. They
                go by various names—Failure Ghosts, Idea Ghosts,
                Mistake Ghosts, Chance Ghosts, Regret Ghosts—and
                Millions of others. Face your Ghosts.
                Walk right up to your Ghosts. Shake hands with
                them. Look them in the eye. Give them a hearing.
                [24]
                You Can
                And then kick them out—for they never will do you any
                good.
                Face your Ghosts.
                Ghosts are always on the Job. In the office of the
                Doctor, Lawyer, Business man, in your Home, on the
                Street—everywhere. But Ghosts get uneasy in the
                Light. They are bom and bred in the Dark Alleys and
                exist only by the Sandbag. Your cue is to keep the Lights
                turned on—your Mind open—yotir Courage alert
                —
                your Character Impregnable.
                Face your Ghosts.
                To-day when you read your newspapers there will be
                Ghosts between the Lines of the Print. Ghosts seek you
                out and constantly try for your scalp. They like TimeWasters, The Man-Afraid-of-His-Job Hesitaters. They
                revel among the players of idle Good-fellowship. But
                Ghosts sneak like cowed dogs with their tails between
                their legs, at the sight of Doers, Time Users, Obstacle
                Riddlers, and Path Makers. Be unafraid of Ghosts.
                Face your Ghosts.
                But don't harbor them. Live, Red-Blooded Men
                can't be dragging around a lot of Ghosts and amount to Anything.
                Face yoiur Ghosts.
                Respedt
                RESPECT is the name of the Fellow who tends door
                for your Conscience. His is the most sacred
                Office in the gift of your Character. For, when
                he goes wrong" Conscience becomes ill unto Death.
                Nothing of Winning matters with Respect gone.
                Respect is your most faithful Friend, your greatest
                [25]
                You Can
                Guide, yotir most powerful Protector—your safest Pilot into Port. Nothing of Winning matter with Respect gone.
                And Respect is made at home. You are your own
                Respect. For a man can be on no better terms with
                anybody than with his Own Self. The Man without
                Respect is a Make-believe, a Fraud—a Counterfeit.
                Nothing of Winning matters with Respect gone.
                Respect yourself and other people will be compelled to Respect you—and you will Repect them. Respect is the beginning of Wisdom. With Respect on guard, you
                look people squarely in the Eye without wavering.
                With Respect, active and unafraid, you go ahead to move away Rubbish and Obstacles and pave a Path for other people to walk in from which they profit.
                Nothing of Winning matters with Respect gone.
                Think about this as you move about To-day. Let it keep you Strong. Let it make you indomitable. Let it
                lift you from your present position into one higher up.
                Let it make of you a Leader. 
                Nothing of Winning matters with Respect gone.</p8>
