            <h2>Believe in Yourself</h2>
            <p>Author: Joseph Murphy</p>
            <p>Description:</p>
            <p1>Many years ago, he printed an article on reincarnation. These pamphlets were on display on a book counter of a church where he lectured. In the beginning, very few of the pamphlets were sold because the salesgirl disliked the contents.</p1>
            <P2>The author then explained the Biblical meaning of reincarnation to her. She understood all the contents and became enthusiastic about the booklets. They were all sold before the author’s lecture was completed. The author was astonished after seeing this. This is an example of a right mental attitude.</P2>
            <P3>Your mental attitude means what your mental reaction to people, circumstances, and objects near you is.

                It directs your relationship with your co-workers? Are you friendly with people, animals, and the Universe? Do you think that the Universe is doing wrong things to you? In short, what is your attitude?
                
                So, if your attitude is not right, then how can you develop the right mental attitude? Let’s see how you can do it.</P3>
            <P4>You can develop the right mental attitude when you realize that nothing external can irritate you or hurt you without your mental consent. You are the only thinker in your world, and nothing can move you into anger or sorrow without your mental consent.

                Realize that you are the master of your thought world. Emotions follow thought. Hence, you are supreme in your own orbit. Just believe in yourself.
                
                Do you permit others to influence you? Do you allow the headlines in the newspapers and the gossip of others to frustrate you? If you do, then your attitude is wrong, and you need to change it and just believe in yourself.
                
                Do you imagine the evil of others? If you do, notice the emotion generated in your deeper self; it is negative and destructive to your health and prosperity. Imagine that another person is mean and dishonest; notice the emotion generated in yourself.
                
                Now reverse the situation and imagine the same person as honest, sincere, and loving; notice the emotion generated in you. Is it positive? Are you not, therefore, master of your attitudes?
                
                In reality, the truth of the whole matter is that your view of God determines your whole attitude toward life in general. If your view is that God is the spiritual power within you, who is always guiding you and taking you towards prosperity, then you will look at the world in a positive and affirmative way.
                
                A young boy of sixteen going to school said to the author, ‘I am getting very poor grades. My memory is failing. I do not know what’s the matter?’ The only thing wrong was his attitude. He adopted a new mental attitude by knowing how important his studies were to get entrance into a good college and become a lawyer.
                
                He began to pray significantly, which is one of the quickest ways to change the mentality. This young boy realized that there was a spiritual power within him. He also began to claim that his memory was absolutely perfect and that infinite intelligence always told him everything he needed to know.
                
                He began to radiate love and goodwill to teachers and fellow students. This young boy is now enjoying greater freedom than he has ever enjoyed earlier, and you can do this too. Just believe in yourself.</P4>
            <P5>Imagination
                Believe in Yourself Summary
                We have said previously that all our mental attitudes are conditioned by imagination. If you imagine that it is going to be a black day today, that business is going to be very poor, that it is raining, and that no customers will come into your store, then you will see the result of your negative imagery.
                
                Imagine that things are lovely, noble, and good. Your entire emotional attitude towards life will change. What do you imagine about life? Is your life going to be happy? Or is it one trapped with frustration?
                
                It is really out of the imaginative mind of man that all religions are born. It is out of the realm of imagination that television, the radio, super jets, and all other modern inventions came. Your imagination is the treasure house of infinity, which releases to you all the precious jewels of music, art, poetry, and inventions.</P5>\
            <P6>The reason is simple. These people are habitually negative; that is, most of their thinking is of a negative and destructive nature. As they continue to make a habit of these negative patterns of thought, they condition their subconscious mind negatively.

                So make a choice now. Begin to think constructively. To think is to speak. Your thought is your word. Let your words be like a honeycomb, which is sweet to the ear.
                
                What is your inner speech like at this moment reading this summary? Perhaps you are saying to yourself, “I can’t do it. It is impossible. I’m too old now. What chance have I? I have no money.”
                
                You can see your words are not like honey. They are not sweet to your ear; they do not lift you up or inspire you. So take a pledge by saying these words to yourself. Repeat them with me. “From this moment, I will allow only those ideas and thoughts in my mind that inspire me and strengthen me.”</P6>
            <P7>Talking to subconscious mind
                So now, let’s see how you may positively convey an idea or mental image to your subconscious mind.
                
                Believe in Yourself English
                The conscious mind of man is personal and selective. It chooses, analyses, and selects. It does all the work of reasoning. Just believe in yourself and move.
                
                The subconscious mind can also be seen as a servant of the conscious mind. The subconscious obeys all the orders of the conscious mind. The conscious mind of a man is the motor and the subconscious is the engine. You have to start the motor, and the engine will do the work. Because of the conscious mind, the power of the subconscious mind is awakened.
                
                Step 1: The quiet mind
                The first step in conveying your clarified desire, idea, or image to the subconscious mind is to relax and immobilize the attention to get quiet. This quiet, relaxed, and peaceful attitude of mind prevents extra matter and false ideas from going into your mind. Furthermore, in the quiet, passive, receptive attitude of mind, the effort is reduced to a minimum.
                
                Step 2: Imagine
                In the second step, you begin to imagine the reality of that which you desire. Here the author gives his example, and you too can use this example to achieve your desired thing. Just believe in yourself and imagine.
                
                The author wanted to sell his home. So he placed the board in front of his garden that said ‘For sale by owner.’ The second day after placing the sign, he asked himself as he was going to sleep, ‘Suppose you sold the House, what would you do?’
                
                Then he answered his own question. And said, ‘I would take that board down and throw it in the garage.’ In his imagination, he took out the board and threw it in the garage, and he felt the inner satisfaction of it all, realizing that it was finished. He just believed in himself.
                
                The next day a man gave him a deposit of $1000 and said, “Take your board down; we are buying this home now”. Immediately the author pulled the board down and took it into the garage. The outer action happened because of the inner. The type of image impressed on the subconscious mind, so is the type of image formed in your life.
                
                If a person has a mortgage due at the bank but he does not have much money to cover it – if he applies this principle, then the subconscious mind will provide him with the money. Never think about how it happened and from where it will happen. Just believe in yourself.
                
                The subconscious mind has ways you know not of. It is one of the instruments that God gave to man, so he could complete his needs. The man who hasn’t the money to give the mortgage to the bank can imagine himself giving a cheque to the cashier.
                
                The important point is to become intensely interested in the mental picture you have created and make it real and natural. The more nicely you engage with that picture, the more effectually will the imaginary picture be deposited in the subconscious mind.
                
                Suppose you are saying that I am not able to see any way to get the money to pay off the mortgage. But do not worry about it. Realize that there is a power inherent within you that can provide you with everything you say to provide it. You can now live with the feeling that: ‘My house is free from all debt, and I have a lot of money.’
                
                Do not question where you will get money to repay the mortgage. You can also imagine a letter from the bank in which it is written that you have paid up all the debt. Live with it until it becomes real for you.
                
                Become convinced now that there is a power within you that is capable of bringing what you imagine. And the important thing is that sitting idly by day, daydreaming, or just imagining the things you would like to possess will not attract them to you. You must actually believe that you are operating a law of mind.</P7>
            <P8>Know what you want
                The subconscious mind will carry out the idea because you have a clear-cut concept of what you wish to possess. Imagine clearly the fulfillment of your desire. The subconscious mind is the film upon which the picture is impressed. And then, the subconscious develops the picture and sends it back into real-world – meaning – in the material form.
                
                The individual who habitually maintains a mental attitude of faith succeeds in life. The individual who remains depressed attracts failure in his life. That’s why make an attitude of faith.
                
                Believe in Yourself Hindi
                God is always successful in his undertaking. Man is equipped to succeed because God is within him. All the potentialities and all the qualities of God are within man. You are born to win.
                
                Also, the intelligence of God is within you, which can raise you above all difficulties. Accept the fact that you have inner creative power. This power is responsive and reactive to your thoughts. If a man thinks of failure, the thought of failure attracts failure. That’s why always think and speak positively.
                
                A business friend of the author, who was a tailor one time, told the author that: “All I ever do is add. I never subtract.” He means that success is a plus sign. Just believe in yourself and let the magic unfold.
                
                Add to your growth, wealth and power, and knowledge. You add to your life by imagining whatsoever things are true and lovely. Imagine yourself being successful and feeling this thing with your heart. You must become successful. You are never a slave to external conditions. You are the master of them.</P8>
            <P9>Conclusion
                Friends, you just saw a miracle unfold before you in this summary.
                
                Go to your reservoir of immense possibilities and think and be like anything you ever wanted. Just imagine, and be positive, and wonders are bound to happen as you are the creation of this Universe.
                
                God bless you all !</P9>
